# School Fee Payment System

## Project Overview
The **School Fee Payment System** is a comprehensive application designed to facilitate the management of fee payments for primary and junior high schools. This system allows parents to pay school fees online, which streamlines the payment process and reduces administrative workload for school staff.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-fee-payment-system.git
   cd school-fee-payment-system
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set your environment variables. You can refer to `.env.example` for the required variables.

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

For development purposes, where you want both backend and frontend servers running, use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch both servers concurrently.

## Features
- User authentication with JWT.
